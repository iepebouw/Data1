## Amsterdam TourBoats
Amsterdam has set progressive goals in order to comply with the Clean Air Policy. The city must be completely emission-free by 2030, and the goal is to have exclusively emission-free pleasure boats within the canal belt by 2025. All boats have a vignette, and from 2025 on only boats with a green vignette (electric or hand-propelled boats) or a yellow vignette (hybrid-boats, only using electric motor when entering the emission-free zones) are allowed to enter the canals of the city center. The through shipping routes are an exception from this, and boats with white () or red () vignettes are still allowed to enter these waterways until the transitional periode of 4 years ends. The IJ ferries that connect Amsterdam North with the rest of Amsterdam also need to be emission-free by 2025. 

Even though the event will take place in 2024, it is still important to limit the pollution levels in the swimming water and to have safe water quality. The municipality also wants to create ideal conditions to ensure high performances. In addition, the event must be energy neutral. To make sure that the swimming route of the Paralympics meets this requirements, we need several data sets. Data on the motor of the boats, peak hours on the canals, carbon footprint, wind and solar energy is in the table below.
