### Plot the amount of AirBnB locations per neighbourhood.

### Which street in Amsterdam has the most AirBnB apartments?

### Try to cross reference the data from the AirBnB dataset with the BBGA. Can you figure
out if all apartments of AirBnB are designated as housing? Which number of
apartments are not rented out all the time but are also used as normal housing?

### How many hotel rooms should be built if Amsterdam wants to accommodate the same
number of tourists?
