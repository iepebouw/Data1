# Amsterdam Housing
{: .no_toc }

There are 30.000 visitors expected during the Paralympics. Only a part of these visitors are tourists, but to make this assignment more clear, we consider all the visitors as people who might need a roof above their heads during the event. For this exercise we used the data from the [Dataset Basis Bestand Gebieden
Amsterdam (BBGA)](https://onderzoek.amsterdam.nl/dataset/basisbestand-gebieden-amsterdam-bbga) and the data set about [Airbnb's](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) in Amsterdam.

### What Amsterdam will receive from tourist tax if the event lasts a week and you will have 30.000 visitors?
The municiplity of Amsterdam will receive 30.000 (visitors) * 3 (euro) * 6 (nights) = 540.000 euro

### Plot the amount of AirBnB locations per neighbourhood.

### Which street in Amsterdam has the most AirBnB apartments?

### Try to cross reference the data from the AirBnB dataset with the BBGA. Can you figure
out if all apartments of AirBnB are designated as housing? Which number of
apartments are not rented out all the time but are also used as normal housing?

### How many hotel rooms should be built if Amsterdam wants to accommodate the same
number of tourists?

### How many different licenses are issued?
