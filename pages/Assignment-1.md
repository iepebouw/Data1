## Amsterdam Paralympics
Paris is hosting the Paralympics in 2024. One of the events at the Paralympics is an open water
swimming event in the Seine (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the City
of Amsterdam thinks it is beter than Paris, they want to host an event before the Paralympics,
snubbing the Parisians. The idea is to host a 5km. open water swimming event through the
canals of Amsterdam. We were asked by the municipality of Amsterdam to advise on the
feasibility of the event from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an
environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in May.

There are several requirements and wishes to take into account. First of all, the event should not impede the waterway of commercial boats. Moreover, the event preferably also does not have an impact on the routes of canal boats. On top of this, the water should be safe to swim in. During other events, like the Amsterdam City Swim in 2015, a considerable amount of participants reported sicknessess after a week. Gastrointestinal illness causes diarrhoea, 
indigestion, nausea and stomach-ache. The water in the canals should be regularly checked and monitored, especially during the weeks around the event. Heavy weather conditions influence the quality of the water, because this could lead to overflowing sewage systems. To conlude, data about the intensity of the use of the canals is needed, popular routes for commercial and canal boats and the water quality are needed. 

In the table below we listed useful data-sets covering the above mentioned requirements.

From the figure below (grachtenmonitor, 2022) we can conclude that the canalbelt is an intensively used waterway for commercial boats and tour boats, especially during the summer the event would have too much of an impact on the waterway. Thus, the event should take place outside of the city center canals. ![image](https://github.com/iepebouw/data1/assets/144791642/aaf274e0-351c-40aa-8ca7-338b1d4b4446)


Moreover, from the data-sets above can be derived that there is are no official open water swimming locations. Official swimming locations are monitored regularly (although once a month does not seem enough to us), so it becomes clear which water is safe to swim in. Before the event the water should be more frequently monitored and the canals need to be cleared from obstacles in the water, like bikes and other bulky objects. Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) and Enterococci are harmful bacteria that could cause sickness when it is present in large quantities. As can be seen from the map below, currently there are no measurements done on these bacteria in the center of Amsterdam. In order to choose a suitable location for the Paralympics, sufficient data about harmful bacteria like E. Coli is needed.
