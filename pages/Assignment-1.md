## Amsterdam Paralympics
Paris is hosting the Paralympics in 2024. One of the events at the Paralympics is an open water
swimming event in the Seine (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the City
of Amsterdam thinks it is beter than Paris, they want to host an event before the Paralympics,
snubbing the Parisians. The idea is to host a 5km. open water swimming event through the
canals of Amsterdam. We were asked by the municipality of Amsterdam to advise on the
feasibility of the event from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an
environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in May.

There are several requirements and wishes to take into account. First of all, the event should not impede the waterway of commercial boats. Moreover, the event preferably also does not have an impact on the routes of canal boats. On top of this, the water should be safe to swim in. During other events, like the Amsterdam City Swim in 2015, a considerable amount of participants reported sicknessess after a week. Gastrointestinal illness causes diarrhoea, 
indigestion, nausea and stomach-ache. The water in the canals should be regularly checked and monitored, especially during the weeks around the event. Heavy weather conditions influence the quality of the water, because this could lead to overflowing sewage systems. To conlude, data about the intensity of the use of the canals is needed, popular routes for commercial and canal boats and the water quality are needed. 

In the table below we listed useful data-sets covering the above mentioned requirements.
